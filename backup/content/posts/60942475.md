Nathan shivered as Wout ran his thumb over the pucker of his ass. Wout pressed down and watched as the vibrations rippled over Nathan's back.

Wout spit onto the pink ring of muscle. The saliva dripped down Nathan's perenium. Wout licked it back up, reversing its path with his tongue.

"More," Nathan pleaded.

"You know this is just the warm\-up," Wout said. He was always careful to maintain a delicate balance. Don't push him too hard, only just hard enough.

Still, Wout did as Nathan asked. He pushed his thumb inside and held him open so he could lick deeper.
