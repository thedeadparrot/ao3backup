The handcuffs rattle against the bed frame as Wout yanks on them. It's an involuntary gesture. He's not trying to get away. Good.

"You're right. He is prettier like this," Pauline says as she fondles Wout's balls with her strong fingers. Dylan knows what it's like to have her hands there. He doesn't blame Wout for the moan that escapes.

"Just wait until you start hurting him," Dylan promises.

Wout's hips buck into Pauline's touch at the mention of pain. The rattling gets louder.

Her eyes light up. "Let's do that next."

Dylan doesn't think he could love her more.
