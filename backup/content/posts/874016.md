summary: 'AU. For the longest time, wanting was uncomfortable, scary, something that
  set you apart, something that made you odd and wrong and different. It feels good
  now, to know that you can have what you want, to know that it will smile at you
  and laugh with you and kiss you and sing you silly songs on your birthday, that
  it will let you in and let you see it at its most fragile and its most vulnerable.

I wrote this as something of a challenge to myself to see what other sorts of stories I could write with [Twine](http://www.auntiepixelante.com/twine/) over the long weekend. (The answer was 'porn' in case it wasn't obvious.) It's still recommended that you read this in Firefox or Chrome.

In total, this fic is about 1500 words long.
