Jonas knows stripping down all the way would be easier, but they only have so much time before they have the kids again. He wants to make Wout come into his underwear like they're teenagers. He knows he can.

He grinds the heel of his palm into the bulge in Wout's shorts, forcing as much friction as he can get through the denim.

Wout's knuckles are white gripping the armrests of his chair. His breath is short.

"Now," Jonas whispers as he watches Wout with greedy eyes. He presses down as hard as he can.

With a gasp, Wout obeys.
