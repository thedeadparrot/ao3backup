This was written with the [Twine](http://www.auntiepixelante.com/twine/) interactive fiction engine. It requires quite a bit of Javascript, so it's hosted on a separate site. It's highly recommended that you use the latest version of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) to view this as it does use some more advanced CSS features. It will not work at all on IE8 or lower. I haven't yet tested it on IE9.

The full length of the fic is about 25,000 words.
