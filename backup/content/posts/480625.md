Baby you understand me now  

If sometimes you see that I'm mad  

Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?  

When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree  

With a joy that's hard to hide  

And then sometimes it seems again that all I have is worry  

And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy  

I want you to know  

I never mean to take it out on you  

Life has its problems  

And I get more than my share  

But that's one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you  

Oh baby  

I'm just human  

Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting  

Some little foolish thing  

Some simple thing that I've done

Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  

Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Don't let me be misunderstood  

I try so hard  

So please don't let me be misunderstood
