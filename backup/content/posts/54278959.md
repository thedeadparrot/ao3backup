notes: 'I could go on a long spiel about public/private spheres and how it''s a big
  theme of this series, but mostly I wanted to write something silly about the internet
  discovering, uh, Wout in this universe.


  So maybe think of this as a cute, fun chaser to all the heaviness of the previous
  sections. Maybe this is tonal whiplash. I have no idea.


  Big thanks to [this Tumblr workskin](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21099596)
  for making this easier. I made a few of my own tweaks to it as well, but they''re
  pretty minor.'

He skipped right past soft launching and went right into hard launching a new boyfriend in the Instagram stories.

ok, I put on my sleuthing hat. the original Instagram post was tagged Vosgelarar, Belgium. on that day (Feb 18\), they held a club championship cyclocross race there. based on the fact that mathieu put a gold medal emoji over the picture in his story, i think we can conclude that his new boyfriend is one of the winners. the winner of the Category D race is listed as Wout van Aert. they are mutuals on Insta, but wout's account is protected.
check out his profile pic, tho:
![Wout van Aert sitting on a chair and smiling](https://imgur.com/QcOjXOA.jpg)
also, someone in the post's comments mentioned junior world championships. i did some googling, and holy shit??? (that's wout on the left with the silver medal)

i know the recent Sports In Colour article made it sound like they just met, but is it possible he's had a secret boyfriend this whole time?

\#mathieu\#do i need a wout tag now? \#wout\#sorry for going down the conspiracy rabbit hole\#his boyfriend is a cutie\#i think we can all agree with that\#good for him\#i hope we get better pics of them together

So now that we have pictures of Mathieu and Wout from when they were actual children, I am going all in on the Secret Boyfriend This Whole Time theory. I'm also pretty sure Wout got his glow up after they started dating. Mathieu has to be responsible for at least half of it.

Are we sure this is the same guy? Yeah, it's been a decade, and there are some similarities, but I don't think we should get ahead of ourselves.

okay, i looked up Wout in cyclocross24\.com, and he's the only Wout van Aert listed. Some snooping around on Insta found me this pic that he's tagged in (cropped to protect the innocent):
![Wout van Aert in a dress shirt](https://i.imgur.com/0CC40iD.png)
i think it's just that he isn't a teenager anymore.

\#wout\#oh no i think this makes me a creep

Okay, I can kind of see it. But I think maybe we're grasping at straws here.
