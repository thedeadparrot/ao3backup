Lyrics:

I fly like paper, get high like planes  
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name  
If you come around here, I make them all day  
I get one down in a second if you wait

Sometimes I feel sitting on trains  
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game  
Everyone's a winner now we're making our fame  
Bona fide hustler, making my name

All I want to do is BANG BANG BANG BANG!  
And KA-CHING!  
And take your money

All I want to do is BANG BANG BANG BANG!  
And KA-CHING!  
And take your money

Pirate skulls and bones  
Sticks and stones and weed and bombs  
Running when we hit them  
Lethal poison through their system

No one on the corner has swagger like us  
Hit me on my banner, prepaid wireless  
We pack and deliver like UPS trucks  
Already going to hell just pumping that gas

All I want to do is BANG BANG BANG BANG!  
And KA-CHING!  
And take your money

All I want to do is BANG BANG BANG BANG!  
And KA-CHING!  
And take your money

M.I.A.  
Third world democracy  
Yeah, I got more records than the K.G.B.  
So, uh, no funny business

Some, some, some I, some I murder  
Some, I some I let go  
Some, some, some I, some I murder  
Some, I some I let go

All I want to do is BANG BANG BANG BANG!  
And KA-CHING!  
And take your money

All I want to do is BANG BANG BANG BANG!  
And KA-CHING!  
And take your money
