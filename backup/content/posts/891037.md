Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,  

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is,  

Take our hands out of control,  

Take our hands out of control

Now, tell me what you saw,  

Tell me what you saw,  

There was a crowded sea,  

Inside, outside,  

I must have done a dozen each

It was the height I grew, the weight,  

The shell was crushing you,  

I've been around a few

Tell me what you saw,  

I'll tell you what to...  

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ahh ohh  

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ahh ohh
