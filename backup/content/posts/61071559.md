The lake in Tignes is beautiful on a day like this. Clear, sparkling blue water surrounded by white\-tipped peaks.

Tiesj doesn't get to really appreciate it, because he's trying not to let their rented canoe tip over.

"Come on," Matteo begs. "I'm close." He arches up as Tiesj grinds his hips deeper.

The boat rocks in time with Tiesj's thrusts, but it thankfully stays upright.

Matteo comes first, his eyes squeezed shut, his ginger lashes gleaming in the sunshine. Tiesj follows him.

"Much better than American beer," Tiesj announces once they catch their breath.

Matteo punches his arm. "Fuck you."
