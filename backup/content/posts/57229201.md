notes: 'I''ve been wanting to write a time loop story in Twine for a while, since
  video games are pretty much time loops in themselves.


  Thanks to curious\_bibliophile and and\_nobody\_noticed for the encouragement as
  always, and especially this time for helping me playtest this.'

  meet him.


  Unfortunately, everyone and everything wants to get in your way.


  Good thing you''re stuck in a time loop.'

This is an interactive fiction story built using the [Twine](https://twinery.org) engine.

You will have to go through the loop multiple times to get to the ending. Good luck.
