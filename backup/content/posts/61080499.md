Matteo knew that they'd talked about it on the group chat, but he still wasn't prepared to see Christophe sporting a full, bushy mustache at the team's end of the year party.

"Um," Matteo said. His own mustache twitched.

"Are you okay?" Christophe asked. The mustache curled in sympathy. Matteo felt light\-headed watching it.

"You look French," Matteo blurted out.

"I am French. What\-\-"

"I'm too into it," Matteo admitted, and then wished the ground could swallow him whole.

"I like yours, too," Christophe said. He leaned forward and kissed Matteo. Their mustaches brushed together, like they were kissing too.
