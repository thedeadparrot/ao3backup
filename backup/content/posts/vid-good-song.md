Waiting, I got no town to hide in  

The country's got a hold of my soul  

TV's dead and there ain't no war in my head  

And you seem very beautiful to me

Sleeping but my works not done  

I could be lying on an atom bomb  

I'll take care  

Cause I know you'll be there  

You seem very beautiful to me

It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling and rolling  

Picture in my pocket looks like you  

It is the rest of your life keeps a rolling, rolling, rolling along
