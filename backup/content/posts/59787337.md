### Chapter 1


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



Jonas peeked through the curtains to catch a glimpse of the gathered audience. The seats were only a quarter filled. Jonas's nerves still jangled. His first real performance. A miniscule part, only one line. He still felt like throwing up.

Wout gave him a comforting slap on the shoulder. "Stop worrying," he said. "You'll do great."

Jonas frowned. "Easy for you to say."

"Easy for you to do," Wout countered. It was unfair he could be so even\-keeled while wearing a kilt.

"Lay on, Macduff," Jonas sighed, and then they left to take their places so the play could begin.


### Chapter 2


#### Chapter Summary



> Jonas, partway through his debut.


#### Chapter Notes



> For Flowerbed. I got the prompt 'costume' and of course, I had to continue this. 😅


Jonas plucked at the stiff sleeves of his shirt. He resisted the urge to futz with the laces that went up the front. He missed his t\-shirts and jeans.

He paced around backstage as Wout, as Macbeth, and Remco, as Lady Macbeth, talked about murdering him.

Partway through, their Macduff, a friendly Slovenian named Tadej, joined him. "It's fun, yeah?" he said. He flashed Jonas a bright smile.

"Could do without the costumes," Jonas confessed.

"You look great in them, though," Tadej said.

Jonas blinked at him, surprised, but Tadej was called away by the director before he could respond.


### Chapter 3


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> Another for Milo, who seems to be enjoying this AU, and the prompt "mustache."


Jonas took a deep breath and followed Primož onto the stage.

"'Tis he," snarled Robert, as one of the murderers.

"Stand to't," said Sepp, as another.

Primož pretended to squint into the distance through the copious fog. "It will be rain tonight," he said to Jonas.

Sepp said, "Let it come down."

A fight scene ensued then. Plastic daggers flashed in the stage lights. "Oh treachery!" Primož yelled, which was his line, then added on, "ah, shit," which wasn't. His fake mustache had fallen off in the fray.

Jonas picked it up and pocketed it. He could return it later.


### Chapter 4


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> For Milo again! You seem to be enjoying this, so might as well. For the prompt 'golden'.


Wout looked grim and angry when he came off the stage. Macbeth had just finished talking to the witches. He was a man haunted by apparitions and his own guilt.

As the play continued, Macbeth got dirtier, his face painted with brown makeup, to show the moral stain on his soul. Even his crown was tarnished. It wasn't as golden as Duncan's.

Wout rubbed at his face, accidentally smearing the makeup even worse. He looked over at Jonas, who always lurked in the wings to watch, and winced. "Is there's an easy way to fix this?" Wout asked.

Jonas shrugged.


### Chapter 5


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> Some more theater AU for Milo! The prompt was 'family'.


Macbeth's death was big and dramatic. The director was convinced he could get the audience to enjoy early modern English with copious amounts of violence.

Tadej and Wout sparred across the stage with heavy swings of their swords, screaming out their lines as they did so. Tadej mistimed his final swipe and caught Wout's shoulder full on. Wout winced as he fell. Jonas winced in sympathy.

Afterwards, when they were backstage together, Wout asked, "Did you really need to hit so hard?"

Tadej said, "You killed my family," and then he grinned, an expression completely at odds with his words.


### Chapter 6


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> Milo has so many drabbles, this one is also for them. 😂 prompt: 'introvert'


Jonas didn't usually enjoy bars. They were loud and crowded, not conducive to having actual conversations or thinking actual thoughts. He still showed up with the rest of the cast and crew to opening night drinks.

He picked a quiet corner to sit in, nursing his beer. Wout was surrounded by well\-wishers who wanted to praise his performance.

Tadej was the only one who breached his introvert bubble. "You were great."

"Thank you," Jonas replied. He knew Tadej was just being nice.

"No, really. You should audition for a bigger role next time."

Jonas attempted a smile. "Sure," he lied.


### Chapter 7


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> more for Milo. this time the prompt is 'help'


Amateur theater tended to draw extremely passionate people with a lot of strong opinions. Jonas had heard about every piece of advice and passing suggestion there was. Some of the company insisted that everyone needed to have time on the stage, while others insisted that it was better for crew to wholly specialize in their particular roles. Jonas had always agreed more with the latter rather than the former. He enjoyed being backstage, being part of the machinery of the theater operate. He didn't need spotlight the way Wout did.

But Tadej's words got stuck in his mind. What if...


### Chapter 8


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> again for Milo. prompt: 'sunflower'


Jonas visited Wout the next day. During performance weekend, the time between performances became liminal spaces. Jonas was always at loose ends waiting for the evening's show.

They sat at the kitchen table, next to the remnants of Wout's breakfast \-\- not cleared yet; Jonas was here early \-\- and a vase of sunflowers \-\- a gift from Wout's parents, who had come for opening night.

Jonas fiddled with his glass of water. "It's early, but I'm thinking about auditioning for Hero in *Much Ado*."**


**He expected Wout to give him some tough love, but Wout just smiled. "You should."**



### Chapter 9


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> Continuing to add more drabbles for Milo! the prompt was 'lying'


"I didn't have that many lines as Fleance," Jonas said. He fiddled with his napkin and bit his lower lip. "I'm not sure how it will be when I have more. I don't know if I can be convincing."

Wout waved him off. "Everyone makes a big deal out of acting, but it's just lying very creatively."

Jonas sighed. Sometimes Wout could get like this. Just because it was easy for him, he thought it was just as easy for everyone else. "I'm not good at lying," he said.

Wout gave him a pat on the shoulder. "You'll get better."


### Chapter 10


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> Milo has been killing it at this challenge and so has quite a backlog of drabbles to get through. This one is for 'doll.' And while Wouthi is not mentioned by name, know he lingers here in spirit.


Jonas talked to Sepp about it before their next performance. This was Sepp's first play with the company, and he was also considering a larger role in their next production.

"You'll be great!" Sepp insisted with a big grin. "You totally should audition for Hero."

"Any advice?" Jonas asked as they helped the crew set the stage.

"This guy I knew in college insisted on practicing all his lines while staring at a creepy doll."

Jonas wheeled out the cauldron, which had one of their many fog machines inside it. "So don't do that?"

"Definitely don't do that," Sepp agreed.


### Chapter 11


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> continuing on for Milo, prompt: 'yellow'.


Overall, Jonas thought this production of *Macbeth* was great. Wout was obviously a standout. His devolution from a noble soldier to ruthless king was devastating every time Jonas saw it. The tone was suitably dark and dramatic. He even liked the idea to keep the costuming traditionally Scottish in design.

He didn't quite understand why the sets had to be so *yellow*. The castle walls were yellow. The backdrops were yellow. Robert, who had been in those meetings with the director said, "Apparently, it's the color of royalty in China."

"We're in Scotland," Jonas said, completely baffled.

Robert just shrugged.


### Chapter 12


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> once again, into the breach, for Milo, this time for the prompt 'cucumber'. I tried. 😭


During intermission, Jonas was busy rearranging the branches on the forest set when Remco came up to him. He was munching on a raw cucumber. He liked giving lectures on the importance of snacking between scenes. "Have you seen my bowl?"

Jonas shook his head and pushed the leaves away so they wouldn't smack him in the face.

"I need my fucking bowl for the spot scene," Remco said. He gave the cucumber a vicious bite and chewed loudly.

"I'm sorry," Jonas said, which was almost true.

Remco stomped off. "Everyone is so fucking useless," he muttered under his breath.


### Chapter 13


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> (yeah, still for Milo)  
> prompt: 'decision'


Jasper gave his final speech as Malcolm to raucous applause. The stage lights dimmed before the curtains swung closed.

Jonas took a deep breath, holding onto the moment as best he could. There was a certain electricity in the air after a play ended, and the whole company worked themselves hard for months just to experience it.

The cast, including Jonas, all lined up in a row for their final bows. Wout and Remco were in the center as the main leads.

Jonas considered how it might feel to be in their place next time.

And he made his decision.


### Chapter 14


#### Chapter Summary



> last one for Milo (for now)! this time the prompt was 'plushy'. sorry that this also does not feature Wouthi. 😭


#### Chapter Notes



The cast stepped off\-stage after their final curtain call, and Wout gave Jonas a tight, warm hug. Jonas was certain he'd had a beloved plushie growing up, because Wout gave the best hugs.

"You were great," Jonas told him.

"I flubbed the first meeting with the witches," Wout said. "Couldn't get my mouth to say 'Cawdor' for some reason."

Jonas laughed. "You were great," he repeated.

"You were great, too," Wout said.

"I'm going to do it. I'm going to audition for Hero." Jonas confessed. He needed to tell someone, and Wout was his best friend.

"Even better," Wout said.


### Chapter 15


#### Chapter Summary



#### Chapter Notes



> I think? this might be the last one for Milo and maybe my last drabble for this particular collection. The prompt was "future."


It wasn’t actually lucky, and yet a wave of shock, horror, and relief
rolled through the company when Primož broke his leg during his last
scene of their last show. They wouldn’t have to worry about replacing
their Banquo in the future.

“It’s the Curse,” Sepp insisted. He was an easygoing guy, not like someone who would be into ancient superstitions. “He kept calling it, *you know*.”

“That doesn’t mean he deserves it,” Jonas said. He felt
relieved, not competing against Primož for *Much Ado*,
and then felt guilty about it.

“That’s the Curse,” Sepp said. “No one does.”
