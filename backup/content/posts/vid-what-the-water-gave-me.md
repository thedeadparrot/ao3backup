notes: 'This vid is based on fuzzy\_paint''s merman!Eduardo fic [the other side (is
  always greener)](http://fuzzy-paint.livejournal.com/46267.html). I really do recommend
  reading it first. though I guess you could watch it as a vid with some very strange
  ocean metaphors.


  Also, it would not exist without [![[personal profile] ](http://s.dreamwidth.org/img/silk/identity/user.png)](http://merisunshine36.dreamwidth.org/profile)**merisunshine36**,

Lyrics:

Time it took us  

To wear the waterways  

That’s what the water gave me  

And time goes quicker  

Between the two of us  

Oh, my love, don’t forsake me  

Take what the water gave me

Lay me down  

Let the only sound  

Be the overflow  

Pockets full of stones

Lay me down  

Let the only sound  

Be the overflow

Would you have it any other way?  

You couldn't have it any other way  

‘Cause she’s a crueler mistress  

And the bargain must be made  

But oh, my love, don’t forget me  

When I let the water take me

Lay me down  

Let the only sound  

Be the over flow  

Pockets full of stones
